# Nanc: Config

This is a very simple internal package with the environment variables needed to run Nanc. You can control certain aspects of Nanc behavior by passing the following environment variables:

`ERROR_DURATION=<int>` - specifies, in seconds, the time for which an error message will be shown

`SIMPLE_ERRORS=<bool>` - specifies whether detailed error messages or only human-readable headers will be shown
