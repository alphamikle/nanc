1. Hi! This is the interactive example of creation of some page of the Flutter mobile app with Nanc - Not a Normal CMS for Flutter Apps (and not only for them)
2. We will create the next screen
3. First, to do it - we need to create a Nanc model. Lets do it.
4. To select icons I will use already deployed Nanc version and find icons through it.
5. I have defined the model as a "not a collection" because we will have only one such page in the app - one entity
6. Field - is the conception of the parameter (field) of any entity. Every entity in the Nanc should have at least one field - `IdField` and that field will be very helpful to Nanc working
7. Let's add all the fields, what we need to our new app' screen.
8. To show the goal of the added fields I be switching to the Figma design and select that screen details, which will be the Nanc model' fields
9. Let's use our model in the Nanc app, to see, what we're done
10. I will add another fields in silent mode...
11. I have prepared a product image link in the CDN - let's use it
12. Okay - we are almost done with the model. Let's add some not visible for the eye params, such as colors, fonts and so on
13. Before starting to write that video I've made some preparations, like putting the image into the CDN or add custom fonts to the Nanc. I will show you where they are. Adding flow of custom fonts is pretty simple - just add them as a usual fonts into the Nanc build (for admin panel) and your app - for the Nanc Rendering Package. Like here. It's very simple! Okay - lets go to the colors.
14. Seems - we are done with model (I hope). I will add some useful comments to the model code and we will go next - to the UI!
15. OKAY! I've added fields to the model. Let's build the UI. See you soon in the next episode.
