1. Hello, again! In that episode we will create a entire screen for any app with Nanc!
2. To do it we need to add additional field to the model of the screen entity. Cool! Now we are able to create a screen. Let's start!
3. To describe the UI an HTML was chosen as a UI language. It's fully describes almost all Flutter widgets and have almost the same API. For example - `SizedBox` widget will be `<sizedBox width="35"></sidedBox>` tag in Nanc with the same arguments. Okay. Lets describe our screen, finally!
4. First - I will create a gap matrix (with all available paddings between elements)
5. Hmm...why I changed the file and not the Nanc code view? Because I've forgot about "Syncronization" of the Nanc and any of yours IDEs. Let's try it. Cool!!! It works. (of course it works!). How it works? Well - you able to edit any file in any IDE (for example - in the cloud / browser VS Code) and that changes will save with your Nanc. Even if Nanc is running on the web. As you seen - its really works. Well...with gap we are finished here. Let's go next.
6. Header. And the templates üòÄ
7. Let me show you a using of the templates
8. Next reusable component will be button. I will just create the button template without any additional comments. I forgot to prefill all the colors - lets do it. Well...I'm a bugman!
9. Results card indicator (bioindicator) - the next patient
10. Results card itself. Its need to prefill indicator colors
11. Neeeeext...product card!
12. We are ready to create the app.
13. I didn't used Nanc for a long time and yes. Nanc has a fully interactive documentation with the examples of all the components, which are implemented for now. Including custom (your) components
14. Action buttons...lets add them first
15. Results. We want to show them only if we have them. The real backend will rule by them. But how? What about conditional visibility? First - prefill the data. I've mistaked in the field type. Sorry üòù
16. Fuuuhh. I though that there a a some bug. Bug from bugman. Thanks gods - No.
17. We already creating the products block - very fast. Before the UI let's fill some data. Oh. Cool - it is already prefilled by someone ü•π
18. Well done! We are created the new main page for the app (some app üòâ). Very fast, I think and it possible to change everything in real app in the production in the seconds
