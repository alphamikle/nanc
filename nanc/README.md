# Nanc - Not A Normal CMS

Nanc - CMS of new generation. Extensible, adaptable and powerful. You can use it with **your existing backend** (wrote by your hands) or with existed Firebase / Supabase / **any other kind project**, managing your content / data / applications from one place or you can start your new creation using Nanc as a management tool in combination with **any kind of data source** - any cloud or custom backend in the ordinary sense of the word.

Nanc allows you to manage data and content of any complexity, and provides an incredibly powerful mechanism for updating the interface and logic of your Flutter applications in real time, based on a Server driven UI approach pumped up to 999lvl and called Nui. Have you wanted to be able to update your application as if it were a web service? You've got it.

## For which purposes Nanc is better suited

- You want a data and content management system in your existing project
- You are creating a new project based on Firebase, Supabase or other cloud data and logic storage, and you want to manage content and data in them more flexibly and easily than using their own UIs
- You want a content management system, but don't want to use cumbersome Open Source "admin panels" or write everything from scratch for "a lot of money"
- You use Firebase as a backend, and you don't have enough functionality in its UI to make sense of your data
- You are building or have an existing Flutter application, and you want to accelerate the speed of delivery of features to production
- You are building or have a Flutter application and want to be able to test different hypotheses in it **very quickly**
- You create or have a Flutter application and want to update it without long and unpredictable reviews by stores
- You create or have a Flutter application and want to be able to change any aspect of its look and feel in an instant, spending a few minutes of development time instead of hours, days or weeks
