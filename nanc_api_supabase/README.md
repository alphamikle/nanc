# Nanc Supabase API

This package provides you with a fast and easy way to integrate Nanc with Supabase as a Backend/Data Source. You will be able to fully manage all your data in Supabase directly from the Nanc interface, including both creating new records and new tables, relationships between them and much more.

The integration process is described in the simplest, step-by-step and very detailed way in the Nanc documentation, available [here](https://nanc.io/docs/modules/api/nanc_api_supabase).
