# Nanc Local API

This is the simplest implementation of the API for Nanc. Local API allows you to test the CMS as a whole and get an idea of how it works.

In the future this API will be supplemented - Sqlite will be used as a means of data storage, instead of the current implementation in the form of JSON-storage. This will allow to use Local API also as a mock / light version of your own SQL-backend or Supabase, as well as to transfer data between these databases.

You can find all the info about the Local API [here](https://nanc.io/docs/modules/api/nanc_api_local).
